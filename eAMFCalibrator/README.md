# eAMFCalibrator

Calibration suite for the GAMEPLAI in-play models on eAMF (Competitive
Gaming American Football). Takes either stream as input, splits the data
into cells, and asks the only question that matters for a probability:
**when the model said 30%, did it happen 30% of the time?**

```
py -m eAMFCalibrator preflight              # check tables + the play clock
py -m eAMFCalibrator run prod
py -m eAMFCalibrator run candidate
py -m eAMFCalibrator run both               # runs both, then diffs them
py -m eAMFCalibrator compare out/prod_cells.csv out/candidate_cells.csv
```

**Run `preflight` first.** It verifies one thing this suite depends on that
nothing else in the repo has ever needed — see *Open questions* below.

## How an observation is built

1. **Snapshot** — one per drive, taken at the drive's first play. Drives come
   from `INPLAY_FIELD_POSITION_PERIOD`, cleaned with the score-anchored rules
   carried over unchanged from `analysis/clean_possession_sequence.py`.
2. **Quote** — for each of the six selections, the model quote nearest in
   time to the snapshot, within **3 seconds**. Snapshots with no quote in
   range are counted in the coverage block, not silently dropped.
3. **Outcome** — did that selection result true, from `SCORE_ENDGAME`.
   Pushes (final lands exactly on the line) are counted and excluded, since
   there is no 0/1 outcome to score a probability against.

Observations are then aggregated into cells and scored with Brier, log loss
and ECE. Each run writes `<stream>_cells.csv` and `<stream>_observations.csv`
to `out/`, so runs are comparable over time as data accumulates.

## The split axes

| Axis | Buckets |
| --- | --- |
| Score difference | `<= -9`, `-8..-3`, `-2..+2`, `+3..+8`, `>= +9` |
| Time | `Q1`–`Q4`, `OT` (switchable to drive number) |
| Possession | `Home`, `Away` |

Crossed with market (moneyline / spread / total) and selection.

Flipping the time axis to drive number is `TIME_AXIS = "drive"` in
`config.py` — the drive number is already computed and carried on every
snapshot, it just isn't the default until drives reconcile.

## Assumptions worth checking

**The cutoff is read as a start, not an end.** `CUTOFF_START =
"2026-09-17 10:00:00"` keeps data **from** that instant onward, on the
reading that quotes before the change came out of the *old* candidate. Both
streams are cut identically so the two calibrations run on the same
population.

**The cutoff is read as UTC.** `PUBLISH_TIME` is `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` and this
feed is stamped UTC elsewhere (`PRICE_ISSUE_TIME_UTC`). 2026-09-17 was BST,
so if "10am" meant UK local time, set it to `09:00:00`.

**Score difference is `PLAYER_1 − PLAYER_2`** (home minus away), so `>= +9`
means the home side leads by 9+ regardless of who has the ball. Possession
is a separate axis, so the home-leading-while-defending case is still
visible as its own cell.

**Market IDs** are `50`/`51` moneyline, `52`/`53` spread, `54`/`55` totals.
50/51/54/55 are carried over from `analysis/unconditional_calibration.py`;
52/53 come from the `MARKET_DESCRIPTION` text. Lines are parsed from that
description rather than from `FULFILLMENT_SCORE`, which sampling showed
holds the *achieved* margin, not the line.

**Probabilities are rescaled.** GAMEPLAI publishes `PROBABILITY` on 0–100;
everything here works in 0–1.

**`QUOTE_DIRECTION = "nearest"`** allows a quote from just before the
snapshot, as asked. Set it to `"forward"` to take only quotes at or after
the snapshot — stricter about a price predating its own game state, at the
cost of dropped snapshots. The signed gap is on every observation row, so
the bias is measurable either way.

## Open questions

**Does the play feed carry a clock?** The 3-second match needs a timestamp
on `INPLAY_FIELD_POSITION_PERIOD`, and every existing script orders that
table by `EVENT_MESSAGE_COUNT` instead — so whether it has a usable
timestamp is genuinely unknown until a run looks. `preflight` reports what
it finds and `run` stops cleanly if there is nothing usable.

If there isn't one: both streams **and** the play feed carry
`EVENT_MESSAGE_COUNT`, which is the same underlying feed sequence. Matching
on that would be exact rather than approximate, and is a small change.

**Sample size is bounded by matches, not rows.** Drives within a match share
a game and are not independent. Every cell reports both counts; read the
match column. `MIN_CELL_OBSERVATIONS` / `MIN_CELL_MATCHES` gate the "worst
cells" summary for the same reason.

## Tests

```
py -m unittest discover eAMFCalibrator
```

41 tests covering line parsing, market resolution, bucket edges, drive
cleaning, quote matching and the scoring rules. No Snowflake needed — the
database half is exercised separately against a mock.
